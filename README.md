# Knight-Dungeon-Sprite-Animation
2D-Sprite animation experiment with a little knight. (Game Prog 1 exercise)

/--------------------------------/

Henl! If you're reading this and are actually curious about it, this is just an experimental 2D-sprite animation and trap coding. This isn't a whole game itself by any means but instead is how I try out sprite animation on different game objects as well as learning how to code simple movement, coin collection, trap damage, and power boosts. Overall, it was a great experience and I'd love to share this here just to remember my simple roots too.
